Multi-Omics Suite provides a suite of functions to clean, filter, batch-correct,
normalize, visualize, and perform differential expression analysis. While the
package is designed for differential [RNA-seq](https://github.com/CCBR/RENEE)
analysis and multi-omics datasets, it can be used for any data represented in a
counts table. See the website for more information, documentation, and examples:
<https://ccbr.github.io/MOSuite/>
