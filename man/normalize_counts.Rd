\arguments{
\item{moo}{multiOmicDataSet object (see \code{create_multiOmicDataSet_from_dataframes()})}

\item{count_type}{the type of counts to use -- must be a name in the counts slot (\code{moo@counts})}

\item{feature_id_colname}{The column from your input Counts Matrix containing the Feature IDs (Usually Gene or Protein ID). This is usually the first column of your input Counts Matrix. Only columns of Text type from your input Counts Matrix will be available to select for this parameter. (Default: \code{NULL} - first column in the counts matrix will be used.)}

\item{samples_to_include}{Which samples would you like to include? Usually, you will choose all sample columns, or you could choose to remove certain samples. Samples excluded here will be removed in this step and from further analysis downstream of this step. (Default: \code{NULL} - all sample IDs in \code{moo@sample_meta} will be used.)}

\item{sample_id_colname}{The column from your input Sample Metadata table containing the sample names. The names in this column must exactly match the names used as the sample column names of your input Counts Matrix. Only columns of Text type from your input Sample Metadata table will be available to select for this parameter. (Default: \code{NULL} - first column in the sample metadata will be used.)}

\item{group_column}{The column from your input Sample Metadata table containing the sample group information. This is usually a column showing to which experimental treatments each sample belongs (e.g. WildType, Knockout, Tumor, Normal, Before, After, etc.). Only columns of Text type from your input Sample Metadata will be available to select for this parameter.}

\item{label_column}{The column from your input Sample Metadata table containing the sample labels as you wish them to appear in the plots produced by this template. This can be the same Sample Names Column. However, you may desire different labels to display on your figure (e.g. shorter labels are sometimes preferred on plots). In that case, select the column with your preferred Labels here. The selected column should contain unique names for each sample.}

\item{input_in_log_counts}{set this to \code{TRUE} if counts are already log2-transformed}

\item{voom_normalization_method}{Normalization method to be applied to the logCPM values when using \code{limma::voom}}

\item{samples_to_rename}{If you do not have a Plot Labels Column in your sample metadata table, you can use this parameter to rename samples manually for display on the PCA plot. Use "Add item" to add each additional sample for renaming. Use the following format to describe which old name (in your sample metadata table) you want to rename to which new name: old_name: new_name}

\item{add_label_to_pca}{label points on the PCA plot}

\item{principal_component_on_x_axis}{The principle component to plot on the x-axis for the PCA plot. Choices include 1, 2, 3, ... (default: 1)}

\item{principal_component_on_y_axis}{The principle component to plot on the y-axis for the PCA plot. Choices include 1, 2, 3, ... (default: 2)}

\item{legend_position_for_pca}{legend position for the PCA plot}

\item{label_offset_x_}{label offset x for the PCA plot}

\item{label_offset_y_}{label offset y for the PCA plot}

\item{label_font_size}{label font size for the PCA plot}

\item{point_size_for_pca}{geom point size for the PCA plot}

\item{color_histogram_by_group}{Set to FALSE to label histogram by Sample Names, or set to TRUE to label histogram by the column you select in the "Group Column Used to Color Histogram" parameter (below). Default is FALSE.}

\item{set_min_max_for_x_axis_for_histogram}{whether to set min/max value for histogram x-axis}

\item{minimum_for_x_axis_for_histogram}{x-axis minimum for histogram plot}

\item{maximum_for_x_axis_for_histogram}{x-axis maximum for histogram plot}

\item{legend_font_size_for_histogram}{legend font size for the histogram plot}

\item{legend_position_for_histogram}{legend position for the histogram plot. consider setting to 'none' for a large number of samples.}

\item{number_of_histogram_legend_columns}{number of columns for the histogram legend}

\item{number_of_image_rows}{number of rows for the plot image. 1 = side-by-side, 2 = stacked}

\item{colors_for_plots}{Colors for the PCA and histogram will be picked, in order, from this list. If you have >12 samples or groups, program will choose from a wide range of random colors}

\item{make_plots_interactive}{set to TRUE to make PCA and Histogram plots interactive with \code{plotly}, allowing you to hover your mouse over a point or line to view sample information. The similarity heat map will not display if this toggle is set to TRUE. Default is FALSE.}

\item{plot_correlation_matrix_heatmap}{Data sets with a large number of samples may be too large to create a correlation matrix heat map. If this template takes longer than 5 minutes to run, Toggle switch to FALSE and the correlation matrix will not be be created. Default is TRUE.}
