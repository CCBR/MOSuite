\arguments{
\item{counts_dat}{data frame of feature counts (e.g. expected feature counts from RSEM).}

\item{sample_metadata}{sample metadata as a data frame or tibble.}

\item{sample_id_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample names. The names in this column
must exactly match the names used as the sample column names of your input Counts Matrix. (Default: \code{NULL} - first
column in the sample metadata will be used.)}

\item{samples_to_rename}{If you do not have a Plot Labels Column in your sample metadata table, you can use this
parameter to rename samples manually for display on the PCA plot. Use "Add item" to add each additional sample for
renaming. Use the following format to describe which old name (in your sample metadata table) you want to rename to
which new name: old_name: new_name}

\item{group_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample group information. This is usually a
column showing to which experimental treatments each sample belongs (e.g. WildType, Knockout, Tumor, Normal,
Before, After, etc.).}

\item{label_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample labels as you wish them to appear in
the plots produced by this template. This can be the same Sample Names Column. However, you may desire different
labels to display on your figure (e.g. shorter labels are sometimes preferred on plots). In that case, select the
column with your preferred Labels here. The selected column should contain unique names for each sample. (Default:
\code{NULL} -- \code{sample_id_colname} will be used.)}

\item{principal_components}{vector with numbered principal components to plot (Default: \code{c(1,2,3)})}

\item{point_size}{size for \code{ggplot2::geom_point()}}

\item{label_font_size}{label font size for the PCA plot}

\item{color_values}{vector of colors as hex values or names recognized by R}

\item{plot_title}{title for the plot}
