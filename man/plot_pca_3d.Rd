\arguments{
\item{counts_dat}{data frame of feature counts (e.g. expected feature counts from RSEM).}

\item{sample_metadata}{sample metadata as a data frame or tibble.
The first column is assumed to contain the sample IDs which must correspond to column names in the raw counts.}

\item{sample_id_colname}{name of the column in \code{sample_metadata} that contains the sample IDs. (Default: \code{NULL} - first column in the sample metadata will be used.)}

\item{samples_to_rename}{If you do not have a Plot Labels Column in your sample metadata table, you can use this parameter to rename samples manually for display on the PCA plot. Use "Add item" to add each additional sample for renaming. Use the following format to describe which old name (in your sample metadata table) you want to rename to which new name: old_name: new_name}

\item{group_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample group information. This is usually a column showing to which experimental treatments each sample belongs (e.g. WildType, Knockout, Tumor, Normal, Before, After, etc.).}

\item{label_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample labels as you wish them to appear in the plots produced by this template. This can be the same Sample Names Column. However, you may desire different labels to display on your figure (e.g. shorter labels are sometimes preferred on plots). In that case, select the column with your preferred Labels here. The selected column should contain unique names for each sample. (Default: \code{NULL} -- \code{sample_id_colname} will be used.)}

\item{principal_components}{vector with numbered principal components to plot (Default: \code{c(1,2,3)})}

\item{point_size}{size for \code{ggplot2::geom_point()}}

\item{label_font_size}{label font size for the PCA plot}

\item{color_values}{vector of colors as hex values or names recognized by R}

\item{plot_title}{title for the plot}
