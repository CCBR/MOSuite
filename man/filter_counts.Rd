\arguments{
\item{moo}{multiOmicDataSet object (see \code{create_multiOmicDataSet_from_dataframes()})}

\item{count_type}{the type of counts to use -- must be a name in the counts slot (\code{moo@counts})}

\item{feature_id_colname}{The column from the counts data containing the Feature IDs (Usually Gene or Protein ID).
This is usually the first column of your input Counts Matrix. Only columns of Text type from your input Counts
Matrix will be available to select for this parameter. (Default: \code{NULL} - first column in the counts matrix will be
used.)}

\item{sample_id_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample names. The names in this column
must exactly match the names used as the sample column names of your input Counts Matrix. (Default: \code{NULL} - first
column in the sample metadata will be used.)}

\item{group_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample group information. This is usually a
column showing to which experimental treatments each sample belongs (e.g. WildType, Knockout, Tumor, Normal,
Before, After, etc.).}

\item{label_colname}{The column from the sample metadata containing the sample labels as you wish them to appear in
the plots produced by this template. This can be the same Sample Names Column. However, you may desire different
labels to display on your figure (e.g. shorter labels are sometimes preferred on plots). In that case, select the
column with your preferred Labels here. The selected column should contain unique names for each sample. (Default:
\code{NULL} -- \code{sample_id_colname} will be used.)}

\item{samples_to_include}{Which samples would you like to include? Usually, you will choose all sample columns, or
you could choose to remove certain samples. Samples excluded here will be removed in this step and from further
analysis downstream of this step. (Default: \code{NULL} - all sample IDs in \code{moo@sample_meta} will be used.)}

\item{minimum_count_value_to_be_considered_nonzero}{Minimum count value to be considered non-zero for a sample}

\item{minimum_number_of_samples_with_nonzero_counts_in_total}{Minimum number of samples (total) with non-zero counts}

\item{minimum_number_of_samples_with_nonzero_counts_in_a_group}{Only keeps genes that have at least this number of
samples with nonzero CPM counts in at least one group}

\item{use_cpm_counts_to_filter}{If no transformation has been been performed on counts matrix (eg Raw Counts) set to
TRUE. If TRUE counts will be transformed to CPM and filtered based on given criteria. If gene counts matrix has
been transformed (eg log2, CPM, FPKM or some form of Normalization) set to FALSE. If FALSE no further
transformation will be applied and features will be filtered as is. For RNAseq data RAW counts should be
transformed to CPM in order to properly filter.}

\item{use_group_based_filtering}{If TRUE, only keeps features (e.g. genes) that have at least a certain number of
samples with nonzero CPM counts in at least one group}

\item{principal_component_on_x_axis}{The principal component to plot on the x-axis for the PCA plot. Choices include
1, 2, 3, ... (default: 1)}

\item{principal_component_on_y_axis}{The principal component to plot on the y-axis for the PCA plot. Choices include
1, 2, 3, ... (default: 2)}

\item{legend_position_for_pca}{legend position for the PCA plot}

\item{point_size_for_pca}{geom point size for the PCA plot}

\item{add_label_to_pca}{label points on the PCA plot}

\item{label_font_size}{label font size for the PCA plot}

\item{label_offset_y_}{label offset y for the PCA plot}

\item{label_offset_x_}{label offset x for the PCA plot}

\item{samples_to_rename}{If you do not have a Plot Labels Column in your sample metadata table, you can use this
parameter to rename samples manually for display on the PCA plot. Use "Add item" to add each additional sample for
renaming. Use the following format to describe which old name (in your sample metadata table) you want to rename to
which new name: old_name: new_name}

\item{color_histogram_by_group}{Set to FALSE to label histogram by Sample Names, or set to TRUE to label histogram by
the column you select in the "Group Column Used to Color Histogram" parameter (below). Default is FALSE.}

\item{set_min_max_for_x_axis_for_histogram}{whether to set min/max value for histogram x-axis}

\item{minimum_for_x_axis_for_histogram}{x-axis minimum for histogram plot}

\item{maximum_for_x_axis_for_histogram}{x-axis maximum for histogram plot}

\item{legend_position_for_histogram}{legend position for the histogram plot. consider setting to 'none' for a large
number of samples.}

\item{legend_font_size_for_histogram}{legend font size for the histogram plot}

\item{number_of_histogram_legend_columns}{number of columns for the histogram legend}

\item{colors_for_plots}{Colors for the PCA and histogram will be picked, in order, from this list.
Colors must either be names in \code{grDevices::colors()} or valid hex codes.}

\item{plot_corr_matrix_heatmap}{Datasets with a large number of samples may be too large to create a correlation
matrix heatmap. If this function takes longer than 5 minutes to run, Set to \code{FALSE} and the correlation matrix will
not be be created. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{print_plots}{Whether to print plots during analysis (Defaults to \code{FALSE}, overwritable using option 'moo_print_plots' or environment variable 'MOO_PRINT_PLOTS')}

\item{save_plots}{Whether to save plots to files during analysis (Defaults to \code{TRUE}, overwritable using option 'moo_save_plots' or environment variable 'MOO_SAVE_PLOTS')}

\item{interactive_plots}{set to TRUE to make PCA and Histogram plots interactive with \code{plotly}, allowing you to hover
your mouse over a point or line to view sample information. The similarity heat map will not display if this toggle
is set to \code{TRUE}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{plots_subdir}{subdirectory in \verb{figures/} where plots will be saved if \code{save_plots} is \code{TRUE}}

\value{
\code{multiOmicDataSet} with filtered counts
}
\description{
This is often the first step in the QC portion of an analysis to filter out
features that have very low raw counts across most or all of your samples.
}
\details{
This function takes a multiOmicDataSet containing clean raw counts and a sample
metadata table, and returns the multiOmicDataSet object with filtered counts.
It also produces an image consisting of three QC plots.

You can tune the threshold for tuning how low counts for a given gene are
before they are deemed "too low" and filtered out of downstream analysis. By
default, this parameter is set to 1, meaning any raw count value less than 1
will count as "too low".

The QC plots are provided to help you assess: (1) PCA Plot: the within and
between group variance in expression after dimensionality reduction; (2)
Count Density Histogram: the dis/similarity of count distributions between
samples; and (3) Similarity Heatmap: the overall similarity of samples to one
another based on unsupervised clustering.
