  gene_name_column_to_use_for_collapsing_duplicates,

  split_gene_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_dat}{dataframe with raw counts data}

\item{gene_name_column_to_use_for_collapsing_duplicates}{Select the column
with Feature IDs to use as grouping elements to collapse the counts matrix.
The log output will list the columns available to identify duplicate row
IDs in order to aggregate information.
If left blank your "Feature ID" Column will be used to Aggregate Rows. If
"Feature ID" column can be split into multiple IDs the non Ensembl ID name
will be used to aggregate duplicate IDs. If "Feature ID" column does not
contain Ensembl IDs the split Feature IDs will be named 'Feature_id_1' and
'Feature_id_2'. For this case an error will occur and you will have
to manually enter the Column ID for this field.}

\item{aggregate_rows_with_duplicate_gene_names}{If a Feature ID (from the
"Cleanup Column Names" parameter above) is found to be duplicated on
multiple rows of the raw counts, the Log will report these Feature IDs.
Using the default behavior (\code{TRUE}), the counts for all rows with a
duplicate Feature IDs are aggregated into a single row. Counts are summed
across duplicate Feature ID rows within each sample. Additional identifier
columns, if present (e.g. Ensembl IDs), will be preserved and multiple
matching identifiers in such additional columns will appear as
comma-separated values in an aggregated row.}

\item{split_gene_name}{If \code{TRUE}, split the gene name column by any of these special characters: \verb{,|_-:}}
}
\value{
data frame with columns separated if possible
